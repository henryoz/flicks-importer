Work on flicks-scraper is temporarily on hold seeing as the kindly video merchants furnished me with a .csv of their entire movie catablue.

It's massive.

HOWEVER, it's also a chance to dick around with the .csv importer example that I found but didn't use on a work project last month.

So that's nice.

Also, I can't promise that commit messages won't rapdily descend into uninformative movie quotes.

It's not a tumour.
